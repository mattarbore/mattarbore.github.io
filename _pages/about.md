## Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Arbore

Iâ€™m a detail-oriented IT professional with hands-on experience in SQL Server database management, data analysis, and IT support.  I am skilled in building and maintaining databases, automating data reporting with Python, and supporting users in Windows and Linux environments.  Strong background in data integrity, troubleshooting, and system administration.  With a proven ability to streamline workflows, improve reporting accuracy, and provide reliable IT support for technical and non-technical teams.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on:
- **Database design & management** using SQL Server, including data migration and reporting automation.
- **Quality assurance** testing for applications, ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
- **Python scripting** for data processing and automation.
- **Collaboration with development teams** to troubleshoot, improve, and deliver software solutions.

My approach blends technical skill with a focus on clear communication and practical results. Whether itâ€™s building a custom SQL report, testing a new app feature, or supporting end-users, I aim to deliver work thatâ€™s efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
