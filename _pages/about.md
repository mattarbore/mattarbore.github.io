## Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Arbore

Iâ€™m a detail-oriented IT professional with hands-on experience in software development, data processing automation and SQL database management. Skilled in managing SQL Server databases, working in Windows/Linux environments, and applying information security principles.  With a proven ability to create custom Python scripts that streamline workflows and improve reporting accuracy.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on:
- **Database design & management** using SQL Server, including data migration and reporting automation.
- **Quality assurance** testing for applications, ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
- **Python scripting** for data processing and automation.
- **Collaboration with development teams** to troubleshoot, improve, and deliver software solutions.

My approach blends technical skill with a focus on clear communication and practical results. Whether itâ€™s building a custom SQL report, testing a new app feature, or supporting end-users, I aim to deliver work thatâ€™s efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
